        <dt>Dragonslayer Armour</dt>
        <dd>The Dragonslayer Armor is an autonomous suit of armor guarding the 
            entrance to the Grand Archives, and is assisted by Pilgrim Butterflies, 
            which are actually the ones animating the suit. 
            It attacks players with an electrified greataxe and can both attack and 
            guard against player attacks with its massive shield. 
            After being brought down to a certain health threshold, projectiles will 
            start raining into the battle arena.</dd>
