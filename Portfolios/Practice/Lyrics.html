            I make you break
            You move I take
            Love is the answer so they say
            But if I went away
            What would you say
            Would it be enough to make you stay
            As you look to the exit
            I don't even know why I'd do this anymore
            I know there's things I should know

            And I know you can't accept
            She's the love that I kept
            Scared I'll push you away
            But I love you everyday
            I know there's things you should know

            I'm in love not because I want to
            She's become something that I got to see
            Won't you just stick around with me
            Oh and darling
            I mistake intent for better days
            While you mislead me in different ways
            I don't think this is how it's to end

            I'm in love not because I want to
            She's become something that I got to see
            Wont you just stick around with me
            Oh and darling
            I mistake intent for better days
            While you mislead me in different ways
            I don't think this is how it's to end

            I'm in love not because I want to
            She's become something that I got to see
            Won't you just stick around with me
            Oh and darling
            I mistake intent for better days
            While you mislead me in different ways
            I don't think this is how it's to end
